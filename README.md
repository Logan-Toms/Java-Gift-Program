# Java-Gift-Program

## Overview
This repository contains a Java program developed as part of my college coursework. The project demonstrates my proficiency in Java and my ability to design, manage, and implement an object-oriented application. This coursework is part of my Intermediate Programming (CMIS 242) class at the University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Purpose
The main objectives of this project are:
- To develop a gift program system using Java.
- To manage and process gift orders, calculate costs, and generate receipts.
- To implement object-oriented programming principles and practices.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
Throughout this project, I have gained and demonstrated skills in the following areas:
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementing classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **File Handling**: Reading from and writing to files for order management.
- **Data Structures**: Using appropriate data structures for storing and manipulating order data.
- **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling to ensure robust application performance.
- **Java Programming**: Writing clean, modular, and reusable code in Java.

## Project Impact
This project has helped me:
- **Enhance Practical Skills**: Applied theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios, improving my understanding of Java programming and object-oriented principles.
- **Improve Problem-Solving Abilities**: Developed solutions for managing and processing orders, handling errors, and generating receipts.
- **Develop Application Design**: Learned to design and implement an effective object-oriented application.

## Files Included
- `GiftProgram.java`: The main Java file that contains the logic for the gift order system.

## Usage Instructions
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Logan-Toms/Java-Gift-Program.git
    cd coursework-project
    ```

2. **Compile the Java Files**:
    ```bash
    javac GiftProgram.java
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    java GiftProgram
    ```

4. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**:
    - The application will prompt you to enter order details or process existing orders from the files.
    - View the generated receipts and order summaries.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The programming language used to develop the application.
- **File Handling**: Used for reading and writing order and product data.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Principles and practices applied throughout the project.
